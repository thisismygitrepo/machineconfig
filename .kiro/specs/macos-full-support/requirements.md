# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding comprehensive macOS support to the machineconfig package. The package currently provides dotfiles management and system configuration capabilities for Linux and Windows, with basic macOS support that needs to be expanded to achieve feature parity across all supported platforms.

## Glossary

- **machineconfig**: The Python package that manages configuration files (dotfiles) and system setup across different operating systems
- **Dotfiles**: Configuration files that customize system behavior and application settings, typically stored in user home directories
- **Setup Scripts**: Shell scripts that install and configure applications and tools for a specific operating system
- **Package Manager**: System-specific tools for installing software (Homebrew for macOS, apt for Linux, winget for Windows)
- **Platform Detection**: Logic that identifies the current operating system and architecture to execute appropriate installation routines
- **Configuration Profiles**: Collections of settings and applications grouped by purpose (development, productivity, etc.)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want to install essential development tools and applications through machineconfig, so that I can quickly set up a new Mac with my preferred development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the install command on macOS, THE machineconfig system SHALL execute macOS-specific installation scripts using Homebrew
2. THE machineconfig system SHALL install all applications available in the Linux setup that have macOS equivalents
3. THE machineconfig system SHALL provide macOS-specific alternatives for Linux-only tools where direct equivalents don't exist
4. THE machineconfig system SHALL handle Homebrew installation automatically if not present on the system
5. THE machineconfig system SHALL support both Intel and Apple Silicon Mac architectures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want to manage my dotfiles and configuration files, so that I can maintain consistent settings across multiple Mac machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE machineconfig system SHALL create symbolic links for macOS-specific configuration file locations
2. THE machineconfig system SHALL support macOS-specific paths for configuration files (~/Library/Application Support/, ~/.config/, etc.)
3. THE machineconfig system SHALL handle macOS permission requirements for creating symbolic links
4. THE machineconfig system SHALL backup existing configuration files before creating symbolic links
5. THE machineconfig system SHALL encrypt private dotfiles before backup on macOS

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want to install applications through multiple package managers, so that I can access the full ecosystem of macOS software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE machineconfig system SHALL support Homebrew for command-line tools and applications
2. THE machineconfig system SHALL support Homebrew Cask for GUI applications
3. THE machineconfig system SHALL support Mac App Store installations where appropriate
4. THE machineconfig system SHALL handle package manager conflicts and dependencies
5. THE machineconfig system SHALL provide fallback installation methods when primary package managers fail

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using macOS, I want to install development-specific tools and environments, so that I can have a complete development setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE machineconfig system SHALL install macOS-specific development tools (Xcode Command Line Tools, etc.)
2. THE machineconfig system SHALL configure development environments for multiple programming languages
3. THE machineconfig system SHALL install and configure terminal applications and shell environments
4. THE machineconfig system SHALL set up version managers for programming languages (nvm, pyenv, rbenv, etc.)
5. THE machineconfig system SHALL configure Git and SSH settings appropriate for macOS

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want the same package groups and categories available as on other platforms, so that I can install consistent toolsets regardless of operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE machineconfig system SHALL provide all package groups available on Linux with macOS equivalents
2. THE machineconfig system SHALL maintain consistent group names across all supported platforms
3. THE machineconfig system SHALL document any macOS-specific differences in package availability
4. THE machineconfig system SHALL provide interactive selection of packages with macOS-appropriate descriptions
5. THE machineconfig system SHALL handle macOS-specific package dependencies and conflicts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want system-specific optimizations and configurations, so that the setup works efficiently with macOS features and limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE machineconfig system SHALL configure macOS-specific system preferences and defaults
2. THE machineconfig system SHALL handle macOS security features (Gatekeeper, System Integrity Protection)
3. THE machineconfig system SHALL optimize for macOS file system characteristics (case sensitivity, extended attributes)
4. THE machineconfig system SHALL integrate with macOS-specific features (Spotlight, Quick Look, etc.)
5. THE machineconfig system SHALL provide macOS-appropriate error handling and user feedback
