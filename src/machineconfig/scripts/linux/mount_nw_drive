#write an extremely verbose bash script to mount a windows network drive in wsl.
#1) The user is prompted for inputs, and is given examples and defaults if enter was pressed.
#2) Before every command is executed, echo what are you doing and what command is used to achieve that
#3)  echo long '-----------' between steps
#4) Make the code very robust so it can catch all errors and execute gracefully if anything went wrong.
#5) prompt the user whether he wants the process to be done automatically, in which case add settings to fstab file and refresh it.
#6) if username and password not passed, don't pass them to mount command
